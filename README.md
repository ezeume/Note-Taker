# Note-Taker

This is an application that can be used to write, save and delete notes.
The application is for users that need to keep track of a lot of information, as it is easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed. This notes are stored in JSON file and rendered on a screen.

I used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT AND NODE.JS to build this application.
